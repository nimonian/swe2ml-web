# Indices

Writing

$$
x \cdot x \cdot x
$$

is deemed, rightly, as being simply too painful. So instead, we write this as

$$
x^3
$$

The little number tells us how many times we times the thing by itself. You can
(and should) check that

$$
2^3 = 8, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 5^1 = 5
$$

Following the pattern, we discover a few sensible rules:

$$
\begin{aligned}
2^3 & = 8 \\
2^2 & = 4 \\
2^1 & = 2 \\
2^0 & = 1 \\
2^{-1} & = \frac{1}{2} \\
2^{-2} & = \frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

::: tip

Anything to the power $0$ is $1$:

$$
x^0 = 1
$$

(There is one exception, when $x = 0$ then $x^0$ is not defined.)

Anything to the power $1$ is just itself:

$$
x^1 = x
$$

Raising to a negative power puts the thing on the bottom of a fraction:

$$
x^{-n} = \frac{1}{x^n}
$$

:::

So we may have things like

$$
\begin{aligned}
4^2 \cdot 2^{-3}
& = \frac{4^2}{2^3} \\
& = \frac{16}{8} \\
& = 2
\end{aligned}
$$

A bit more investigation leads us to several so called **laws of indices**
