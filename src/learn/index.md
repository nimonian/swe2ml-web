# Introduction

Welcome.

I'm guessing you're here either out of pure curiosity, or because you want to
know more about the mathematics behind machine learning. Maybe you've taken the
top-down approach, you already do some machine learning stuff with Python
libraries, and want to go deeper. Or maybe you're just getting into it and want
to study from the bottom up.

This site is my effort to explain the mathematics in plain, human terms. There
are plenty of great texts on this topic already. This one is less formal, with
more casual commentary and swearing. I hope it is a good stepping stone for
developers to approach the proper texts on this subject with a bit more
confidence. I can only apologise for adding such an irreverant contribution to
the literature.

As we build up the theory, we'll be capturing what we know in classes and
functions. I encourage you to open an editor and write the code with me - it's a
good way of putting formulas and concepts into your mental knapsack. I encourage
you to add comments and extra test cases to the code, and keep notes alongside.

Good luck and have fun :four_leaf_clover:
